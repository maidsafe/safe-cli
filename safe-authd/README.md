## Description

This crate implements a SAFE Authenticator service which runs as a daemon (or as a service in Windows platforms).

The `safe-authd` exposes its services as a [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) interface allowing applications and users to connect to create SAFE Network accounts, log in using an existing account's credentials (passphrase and password), authorise applications which need to store data on the network on behalf of the user, as well as revoke permissions previously granted to applications.

It keeps in memory a list of authorisation requests pending of approval/denial, as well as the list of the registered subscribers that the notifications shall be sent to.

## Download

The latest version of the SAFE Authenticator daemon can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-api/safe-authd/releases/latest). Once it's downloaded and unpacked, you can follow the steps in this guide by starting from the [Launching the safe-authd](#launching-the-safe-authd) section further down in this document.

If otherwise you prefer to build the SAFE Authenticator daemon from source code, please follow the instructions in the next two section below.

## Build

In order to build this application from source code you need to make sure you have `rustc v1.38.0` (or higher) installed. Please take a look at this [notes about Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you need help with installing it. We recommend you install it with `rustup` which will install the `cargo` tool which this guide makes use of.

Once Rust and its toolchain are installed, run the following commands to clone this repository and build the `safe-authd` (the build process may take several minutes the first time you run it on this crate):
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-api.git
$ cd safe-api/safe-authd
$ cargo build
```

Once it's built you can find the `safe-authd` executable at `target/debug/`.

### Using the Mock or Non-Mock SAFE Network

By default, the `safe-authd` is built with [Non-Mock libraries](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_client_libs/wiki/Mock-vs.-non-mock). If you are intending to use it with the `Mock` network you'll need to specify the `mock-network` feature in every command you run with `cargo`, e.g. to build it for the `Mock` network you can run:
```
$ cargo build --features mock-network
```

Keep in mind that if you run the `safe-authd` with `cargo run`, you also need to make sure to set the `mock-network` feature if you want to use the `Mock` network, e.g. with the following command the `safe-authd` will start and be connecting to the `Mock` network:
```
$ cargo run --features mock-network -- start
```

## Launching the safe-authd

The `safe-authd` can be launched with:
1. `cargo run -- <list of arguments/options>`
2. or directly with the executable generated: `./target/debug/safe-authd <list of arguments/options>`

As any other shell application, the `safe-authd` supports the `--help` argument which outputs a help message with information on the supported arguments and options, you can get this help message with:
```
$ safe-authd --help
```

This application supports only a few commands which are required to start it as a daemon, stop and restart it. A couple of additional commands are available also for installing/uninstalling it as a service which is required and supported only for Windows platforms.


### Start (Linux/Mac)

In order to start the SAFE Authenticator daemon (`safe-authd`) we simply need to run the following command:
```shell
$ safe-authd start
Starting SAFE Authenticator daemon (safe-authd)...
```

### Start (Windows)

Windows platform requires you to first install `authd` as a Windows service before being able to start it. It also requires administrator permissions to install and start a service, so please open a console with administrator permissions (you can look at [this guide which explains how to do it on Windows 10](https://www.intowindows.com/command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-10/)), and then run the following commands:
```shell
> safe-authd.exe install
Installing SAFE Authenticator (safe-authd) as a Windows service...
The safe-authd service (<'safe-authd.exe' path>) was just installed successfully!

> safe-authd.exe start
Starting SAFE Authenticator service (safe-authd) from command line...
safe-authd service started successfully!
```

### Stop

To stop the SAFE Authenticator daemon (`safe-authd`) we just run the following command (on Windows make sure you the `safe-authd.exe` executable):
```shell
$ safe-authd stop
Stopping SAFE Authenticator daemon (safe-authd)...
Success, safe-authd (PID: <pid>) stopped!
```

### Restart

We can also restart the SAFE Authenticator daemon (`safe-authd`) if it's already running, with the following command (on Windows make sure you the `safe-authd.exe` executable):
```shell
$ safe-authd restart
Stopping SAFE Authenticator daemon (safe-authd)...
Success, safe-authd (PID: <pid>) stopped!
Starting SAFE Authenticator daemon (safe-authd)...
```
